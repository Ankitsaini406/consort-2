# Firebase Authentication Persistence Configuration

## Current Configuration: `inMemoryPersistence` (HIGHEST SECURITY)

The system is now configured to use **in-memory persistence** for Firebase authentication, which provides the highest security level for admin CMS systems.

## Persistence Modes Explained

### üîí `inMemoryPersistence` (CURRENT - RECOMMENDED)
- **Security Level**: HIGHEST
- **Behavior**: Authentication state only persists while the page/tab is open
- **Clears When**: 
  - Page refresh
  - Tab/browser close
  - Server restart
  - Manual logout
- **Best For**: Admin systems, sensitive applications
- **User Experience**: Users must re-login after page refresh

### üîê `browserSessionPersistence` (MEDIUM SECURITY)
- **Security Level**: MEDIUM
- **Behavior**: Authentication state persists until browser tab is closed
- **Clears When**:
  - Browser tab close
  - Browser restart
  - Manual logout
- **Survives**: Page refreshes within the same tab
- **Best For**: Regular web applications with moderate security needs

### üîì `browserLocalPersistence` (LOWEST SECURITY)
- **Security Level**: LOWEST
- **Behavior**: Authentication state persists across browser restarts
- **Clears When**: Manual logout or token expiration
- **Survives**: 
  - Page refreshes
  - Browser restarts
  - Server restarts
  - Computer restarts
- **Best For**: Consumer applications where convenience is prioritized

## Security Benefits of Current Configuration

With `inMemoryPersistence`, your admin CMS now has:

1. **Auto-logout on refresh** - Prevents unauthorized access if someone walks away from an unlocked computer
2. **No persistent tokens** - Authentication tokens don't survive browser crashes or unexpected closures
3. **Enhanced security** - Combined with the 5-minute inactivity timeout, provides multiple layers of protection
4. **Compliance-friendly** - Meets stricter security requirements for admin systems

## Changing Persistence Mode

To change the persistence mode, edit `src/firebase/firebaseconfig.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change this line to adjust persistence level:
const AUTH_PERSISTENCE_MODE = inMemoryPersistence; // Current (recommended)

// Other options:
// const AUTH_PERSISTENCE_MODE = browserSessionPersistence; // Medium security
// const AUTH_PERSISTENCE_MODE = browserLocalPersistence;   // Lowest security
```

## Security Recommendation

For admin CMS systems like this one, **keep the current `inMemoryPersistence` setting**. The slight inconvenience of re-logging in after page refreshes is outweighed by the significant security benefits.

## Combined Security Features

This persistence change works together with other security features:

- ‚úÖ **In-memory persistence** - No persistent auth tokens
- ‚úÖ **5-minute inactivity timeout** - Auto-logout after idle time
- ‚úÖ **Server-side token validation** - Firebase Admin SDK verification
- ‚úÖ **Rate limiting** - Prevents brute force attacks
- ‚úÖ **httpOnly cookies** - CSRF protection
- ‚úÖ **Secure headers** - XSS and other attack prevention

## Testing the Changes

1. Login to the admin panel
2. Refresh the page - you should be logged out
3. Login again
4. Close the browser tab and reopen - you should be logged out
5. The system should no longer persist login across server restarts

This provides maximum security for your admin CMS while maintaining usability through the session heartbeat system.
